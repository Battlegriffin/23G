This is the final and completed Shop of Maximilian Schwarzmiller's 'Node Js' course,
when finished , the redirection back to the site when the Test Stripe Payment has been
made is unsuccessful , there is something wrong I can't figure out what it is in 
the following code found in shop.js in Controllers:

return stripe.checkout.sessions.create


MONGO URI is in app.js ,
Sendgrid API key is in auth Controllers ,
Stripe SK key is in shop Controllers ,
Stripe PK key is in checkout.ejs in the 'shop' subfolder of views.

Obviosuly mine will not work so the fields there are empty .
